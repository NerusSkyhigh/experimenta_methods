## Homework assignment:

#### Exercise 01 - Sampling Theorem
28 September 2020

This exercise aimed at explaining the critical point of choosing the right sampling frequency when performing a Shannon interpolation. The main difficulty of this exercise was to move from the theory to a practical application.

For this exercise is provided a Mathematica Notebook, but **only** the Jupyter notebook will be updated and corrected.

#### Exercise 02 - Pendulum
13 October 2020

This exercise aimed to be an introduction to linearization and to linear system. There were no intrinsic difficulties, but an oversight of mine lead to me doing all the calculation by hand. Apart from that the exercise was carried out without major problems.

#### Exercise 03 - Pressure Transducer
20 October 2020

This exercise was an introduction to feedback loops and linearization limits.

#### Exercise 05 - Thermal Noise

#### Exercise 06 - Charge Detector
