## Homework assignment:

#### Exercise 01 - Sampling Theorem
28 settembre 2020

This exercise aimed at explaining the critical point of choosing the right sampling frequency when performing a Shannon interpolation. The main difficulty of this exercise was to move from the theory to a practical application.

For this exercise is provided a Mathematica Notebook, but **only** the Jupyter notebook will be updated and corrected.
